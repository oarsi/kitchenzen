It started with food/meal show offs on Twitter and after a while became a hashtag. Over time I looked for a way to store recipes and was also asked if I can share some. So here we go: A recipe collection based on github so I can store and share my recipes and everyone can easiely contribute.

## How to contribute
TBD :)
