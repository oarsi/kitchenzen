## Ingredients
* (500 grams \| 1 pound) of zucchini
* (250 grams \| 1/2 pound) of salmon
* (250 milliliter \| 8.3 fl.oz.) of coconut milk
* (5-6 cm \| 2 inch) of ginger
* 2-3 stems of fresh lemongrass
* 1x red onion
* 1x garlic clove
* some olive oil
* Salt & pepper 
* Sweet Chilli sauce

## Preparation
Cut the zucchinis into threads with a spiral slicer and set them aside. Dice the garlic and onion. Peel and chop the ginger and cut the lemon into pieces.

Fry the salmon in a hot frying pan with some olive oil, but do not yet brown. Put the salmon aside. Fry the garlic, onion and ginger in the same pan. When the onions are glassy, add the coconut milk. 

Add the salmon and lemongrass and cook for a few minutes. Add the zucchini strings and cook covered for another 3-4 minutes, the zucchini should still be firm to the bite.

Season with salt, pepper and sweet chilli sauce.
