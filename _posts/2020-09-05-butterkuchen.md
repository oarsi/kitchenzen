## Ingredients
* (500 grams \| 5 cups) of flour
* (a cube (~42g) fresh yeast \| 3/4 oz Active Dry Yeast)
* (250 milliliter \| 8.3 fl.oz.) of milk
* (100 to 125 grams \| 1/2 cup) of softened butter
* two eggs (once as a whole egg, once the yolk)
* (160 to 180 grams \| 3/4 - 1 cup) of sugar
* (100 to 130 grams \| 1/2 cup) of (salted) butter
* a pinch of salt

## Preparation
First sieve the flour into a bowl to form a small hollow. In it, the yeast is crumbled and mixed with 80 grams of sugar and 125 milliliter lukewarm milk, which has been mixed with the soft butter. Then cover the pre-dough and let it "rise" for about 20 minutes. 

After rising, add the remaining milk, an egg and salt and beat the dough by hand. Let the mixture rise for another 20 minutes in the covered bowl. 

Then roll out the dough on a baking tray greased with butter. To prevent the cake from becoming "bunchy", pierce small holes with a fork. Cover the tray with a tea towel and let it rise a third time (at least 20 min). 

In the meantime, for the topping, chop an egg yolk with 80 to 100 grams of sugar until crumbly with a knife and preheat the oven to (210 degrees Celsius \| 400 degrees Fahrenheit) (top and bottom heat). Press small teespoon sized chunks of the salted butter into the finished dough and then spread the sugar-egg crumbs over it (feel free to add some extra sugar :)). If there are several trays, bake each tray separately for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the desired degree of browning.
